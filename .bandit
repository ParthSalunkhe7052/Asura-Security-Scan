# Bandit Security Configuration for Asura

# Paths to exclude from scanning (glob patterns)
exclude_dirs = [
    '/tests/',
    '/test/',
    '/**/test_*.py',
    '/**/*_test.py',
    '/venv/',
    '/.venv/',
    '/node_modules/',
    '/__pycache__/'
]

# Tests to skip
# B101: Use of assert - skip for all test files
# B404: Import of subprocess - we use it safely
# B603: Subprocess without shell=True - we document all usage
skips = ['B101']

# Only report issues with HIGH confidence
# This reduces false positives while catching real issues
# Options: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH
confidence = HIGH

# Severity level to report
# Options: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH
# We want to see all severities but with high confidence
level = LOW

# Additional Notes:
# - B101 (assert): Suppressed because assert in tests is standard pytest practice
#   Tests are not shipped to production, so this is safe.
#
# - B404/B603 (subprocess): Not suppressed here because we want to be reminded
#   to document any new subprocess usage. All existing usage has # nosec annotations.
#
# - This configuration applies when Bandit is run with: bandit -c .bandit
#   The scanner.py file automatically detects and uses this config.
